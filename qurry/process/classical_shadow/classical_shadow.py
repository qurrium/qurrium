                    Programmable quantum simulators and quantum computers are opening unprecedented
                    opportunities for exploring and exploiting the properties of highly entangled
                    complex quantum systems. The complexity of large quantum systems is the source
                    of computational power but also makes them difficult to control precisely or
                    characterize accurately using measured classical data. We review protocols
                    for probing the properties of complex many-qubit systems using measurement
                    schemes that are practical using today's quantum platforms. In these protocols,
                    a quantum state is repeatedly prepared and measured in a randomly chosen basis;
                    then a classical computer processes the measurement outcomes to estimate the
                    desired property. The randomization of the measurement procedure has distinct
                    advantages. For example, a single data set can be used multiple times to pursue
                    a variety of applications, and imperfections in the measurements are mapped to
                    a simplified noise model that can more
                    easily be mitigated. We discuss a range of
                    cases that have already been realized in quantum devices, including Hamiltonian
                    simulation tasks, probes of quantum chaos, measurements of non-local order
                    parameters, and comparison of quantum states produced in distantly separated
                    laboratories. By providing a workable method for translating a complex quantum
                    state into a succinct classical representation that preserves a rich variety of
                    relevant physical properties, the randomized measurement toolbox strengthens our

                    desired property. The randomization of the measurement procedure has distinct
                    advantages. For example, a single data set can be used multiple times to pursue
                    a variety of applications, and imperfections in the measurements are mapped to
                    a simplified noise model that can more
                    easily be mitigated. We discuss a range of
                    cases that have already been realized in quantum devices, including Hamiltonian
                    simulation tasks, probes of quantum chaos, measurements of non-local order
                    parameters, and comparison of quantum states produced in distantly separated
                    laboratories. By providing a workable method for translating a complex quantum
                    state into a succinct classical representation that preserves a rich variety of
                    relevant physical properties, the randomized measurement toolbox strengthens our
                    ability to grasp and control the quantum world.},
