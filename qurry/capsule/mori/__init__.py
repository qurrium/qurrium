"""Mori - JSON Serializer (:mod:`qurry.capsule.mori`)

## Why names Mori?

    There are many dedicated data structures for Qurrium
    If we say one of them like a tree in forest,
    then all data structures combine,
    it makes a forest or '森' read as mori in Japanese.
    Definitely NOT because I'm a DeadBeat,
    the fan of Hololive VTuber Mori Calliope,
    and I didn't want to name something after her for a not short time.
