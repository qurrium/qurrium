                abstract = {Quantum systems are predicted to be better at information
                processing than their classical counterparts, and quantum entanglement
                is key to this superior performance. But how does one gauge the degree
                of entanglement in a system? Brydges et al. monitored the build-up of
                the so-called Rényi entropy in a chain of up to 10 trapped calcium ions,
                each of which encoded a qubit. As the system evolved,
                interactions caused entanglement between the chain and the rest of
                the system to grow, which was reflected in the growth of
                the Rényi entropy. Science, this issue p. 260 The buildup of entropy
                in an ion chain reflects a growing entanglement between the chain
                and its complement. Entanglement is a key feature of many-body quantum systems.
                Measuring the entropy of different partitions of a quantum system
                provides a way to probe its entanglement structure.
                Here, we present and experimentally demonstrate a protocol
                for measuring the second-order Rényi entropy based on statistical correlations
                between randomized measurements. Our experiments, carried out with a trapped-ion
                quantum simulator with partition sizes of up to 10 qubits,
                prove the overall coherent character of the system dynamics and
                reveal the growth of entanglement between its parts,
                in both the absence and presence of disorder.
                Our protocol represents a universal tool for probing and
                characterizing engineered quantum systems in the laboratory,
                which is applicable to arbitrary quantum states of up to
                several tens of qubits.}
